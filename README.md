# Introduction to Java

What is Java?
- Java is a widely used programming language used by software engineers to create web, mobile, and desktop apps, requiring the Java Development Kit (JDK) for compilation and operation.

Algorithms in Programming
- Computers are data processors that require precise instructions, called programs.
- In the past, these instructions were in zeros and ones, but programmers made it easier with languages like Java.
- Algorithms are now crucial for problem-solving, serving as step-by-step guides for computers to follow.
- Numerous programming languages exist to simplify these tasks.
- As an example on this in real life, To calculate an employee's earnings before deductions, use a step-by-step approach, including calculating hours worked, hourly wage rate, and multiplying by rate, and use programming language like Java.

# Getting Your Java Environment Ready

Getting Your Java Environment Ready
- Installing JDK
   + The Java development kit (JDK) is essential for building and running Java apps on a computer.
   + The standard edition, Java 17.0.2, is suitable for our needs. However, newer versions are acceptable, and it's crucial to choose the appropriate JDK for your operating system.

Installing itenlliJ IDEA
- This course uses IntelliJ, a free and open-source code editor, to create code.
- To download, visit jetbrains.com/idea and download the Community Edition.
- Open the app on a Mac or follow the installation prompts on Windows.
- The IDE, or integrated development environment, is where all code will be written, making it easy to use and use for future coding.

Executing Java Programs
- Java programs can be written and run using text editors and the command line, but this approach can become unwieldy as the program grows.
- An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a solution that is focused on coding and offers built-in tools to streamline the software development process.
- Its graphical user interface (GUI) allows users to skip typing out command lines and run code with just a click. Additionally, an IDE comes with a debugger, making coding quicker and simpler.
- IntelliJ, a custom-made IDE for Java development, is used in this course. It comes in two flavors: a paid ultimate version and a free community version. The community version is suitable for this course.
- IntelliJ is a popular choice for Java development, as it offers a graphical user interface and a debugger for spotting and fixing errors.

Explore Intellij IDEA
- IntelliJ IDE is a powerful tool for creating and modifying Java programs.
- To begin, click on "New Project" and configure settings, including the Java version.
- For beginners, choose Java 20 and download the JDK for Java 20. Name the project "Learning Java" and create a new folder on your desktop. Start the project by clicking "Create" and use the navigation pane to switch between different project files.
- The SRC folder is the source code hub, where most of the coding takes place.
- The external library section links up the Java Development Kit (JDK) for your Java projects.
- In the top-right corner, you can run and debug your program. To compile and run the program, hit the play button. However, the "Debugging" button is grayed out as you have not written any Java code yet.
- Start crafting your Java code and enjoy the excitement!

Writing Your First Java Program
- To begin writing your first Java program, create a Java file in the SRC folder and choose "New" or "Java class" to create a new Java class.
- Java is known for its verbosity, which can be beneficial for beginners as it helps them understand concepts better.
- Every Java program needs a class, which is the foundation of all Java code.
- The code editor in the main pane is used to write the code, which can be easily accessed in the SRC folder by double-clicking it.
- To tweak the code, add extra Java code inside curly brackets, which are the main functions that start the program.
- Any action scribbled within these curly braces gets green light when the run button is pressed. The program gets its own flavor from what is spelled inside those curly braces, such as the "system.out.println" trick.
- In this beginners' journey, we will learn about "void" and "static" in the future, as well as the basics of Java 101.

Running Your First Java Program
- The text outlines the basics of a Java program, including the main function, which serves as the VIP entrance.
- The HelloWorld class is the lead role, and the main function is a supporting function.
- To run the program, simply click the "Run HelloWorld.main" button in the IDE.
- The program will then display a console at the bottom of the screen, where it will greet the user with a "Hello World!" message.
- To run the program one-click, set up a special configuration in the top right corner.
- Edit the HelloWorld class, which is grooving with Java 20 and knows the main act is in the HelloWorld class.
- Click "Cancel" to avoid messing with the configuration.
- The Play button on the right will change from gray to green, and the console will display the "HelloWorld" message.
- This is the first Java program show using the IDE.
